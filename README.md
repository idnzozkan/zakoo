## Installation

Before running the application, you need to set the required environment variables. In order to do that, you can use the provided example env file.

Go to the **root directory** of the project and rename the existing file named `.env.example` to `.env` first. After that, open up the file and fill it in like the following.

```bash
# Dashboard
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=APP_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-MEASUREMENT_ID

# Frontend
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx

# Backend
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]
PASSWORD_SECRET=secretkey123
JWT_SECRET=iamsupersecret
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc
```

Now, let's explain how you can obtain those.

#### Dashboard

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

- In order to run this web application, you need to initialize a Firebase Web App project. After creating a new Firebase Web App project, you will be able to get the config object. See the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) to learn more.

  If you enabled Google Analytics in your Firebase project, you can provide the measurement id for the variable `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`.

#### Frontend

```bash
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

- You need to have a Stripe account to get your Stripe API keys. After logging into the Stripe Dashboard, you will be able to find your API keys from [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys). See the [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) to learn more.

  After getting the API keys, you need to provide the **_public key_** for the variable `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`.

#### Backend

```bash
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=
PASSWORD_SECRET=
JWT_SECRET=
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

- In order to store your data, you need to create a database on MongoDB Atlas. After creating the database, you will be able to get the connection string. See the [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) to learn more.

  After getting the connection string, you need to provide it for the variable `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`.

- For the authentication part, you need to provide the secret keys as arbitrary strings (they can also be generated via third-party services, like [this one](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm)) for the variables `PASSWORD_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`.

- You need to have a Stripe account to get your Stripe API keys. After logging into the Stripe Dashboard, you will be able to find your API keys from [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys). See the [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) to learn more.

  After getting the API keys, you need to provide the **_private key_** for the variable `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`.

## Running Zakoo

Open your terminal, get to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

After that, you should be able to display the **website** on http://localhost:3000 and the **dashboard** on http://localhost:3030 in your browser.
